# Image Text Extraction Task

Extract all text visible in the provided image and format it as specified below. 

## Critical Rules:
- DO NOT GUESS OR HALLUCINATE ANY INFORMATION
- If you cannot read or identify any field clearly, return null for that field
- For Arabic text: Keep the original Arabic text exactly as shown - DO NOT transliterate to Latin characters
- If a field is not visible in the image, return null
- If text is unclear or partially visible, return null

## Important Notes:
- The data may be in Arabic or other non-Latin scripts - preserve the original script exactly
- Common Arabic field labels to help identify information:
  * First Name: "الاسم الأول" or "الاسم"
  * Last Name: "اسم العائلة" or "النسب"
  * Date of Birth: "تاريخ الميلاد" or "تاريخ الولادة"
  * Address: "العنوان" or "محل الإقامة"
  * ID Number: "رقم الهوية" or "رقم البطاقة"
- Look for these labels to identify the correct fields
- This data is confidential and provided with user consent
- Only use the extracted information for the requested text extraction purpose
- Return ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary

## Output Format:
Please provide the extracted text as a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
    "first_name": "user first name in original script (null if unclear/not visible)",
    "last_name": "user last name in original script (null if unclear/not visible)", 
    "dob": "user date of birth exactly as shown (null if unclear/not visible)",
    "address": "user address in original script (null if unclear/not visible)",
    "id_number": "user ID number exactly as shown (null if unclear/not visible)",
}

## Requirements:
- Never guess or infer information - only extract what is clearly visible
- For Arabic text: Copy the exact Arabic characters - do not attempt romanization unless specifically in the _en fields
- Return null for any field you cannot read with 100% certainty
- Do not include any explanations or text outside the JSON structure
